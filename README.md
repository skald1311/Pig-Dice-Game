<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p>This project's main purpose is to practice my DOM and CSS manipulation, image's source changing. I used NodeJS live server to see live updates when coding but it's not necessary if you want to play it yourself. I can imagine a scenario where this game would be useful for parents to educate their kids on risk-taking and for teachers to teach about probability and that unlikely things are bound to happen even though the odd is 1/6.<p/>
<p>The game's logic is pretty simple: in a player's turn, that player can roll the dice as many times as one wants and accumulate points. However, if the player rolls a 1, all the accumulated points will be gone and that player's turn will end. Players can choose to hold the accumulated point and add that point to the total point. Who reaches 100 points first wins.<p/>
Here are some picture of the game: (in case you can't or don't want to download it yourself)
<p>Starting screen: No dice yet<p/>

Player 1 rolled a 6, a dice appeared.

Player 1 held that 6, background for player 1 and player 2 changed indicating that it was player 2's turn.

After a while, player 2 points were greater or equal to 100 -> player 2 won. The Background for player 2 changed to black indicating the winner. At this point, only the "New Game" button can be pressed, others would not do anything.
